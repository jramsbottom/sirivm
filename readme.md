# BODS Siri VM processor

This project provides a Python-based solution for processing Siri VM data from the BODS API and also the Siri VM bulk download endpoint. It's designed to fetch, extract, transform, and load (ETL) data for further analysis or storage in a SQLite database.

## Features

- **API Data Extraction**: Fetches XML data from specified API endpoints.
- **ZIP File Processing**: Extracts and processes XML data from ZIP archives.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies necessary transformations to the extracted data.
- **Database Integration**: Loads transformed data into a SQLite database, ensuring data integrity and avoiding duplicates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library for API requests
- `lxml` library for XML parsing
- `sqlite3` module (included with Python)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd yourprojectname
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install requests lxml
   ```

### Usage

To start processing data, run the `main.py` script with the desired mode (`api` or `zip`):

```bash
python main.py api
```

or

```bash
python main.py zip
```

Ensure you set the `BODS_API_KEY` environment variable for API access:

```bash
export BODS_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

## Modules

- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the application, handling user input to select the data source.
- **`api_extract.py`**: Manages fetching and processing data from APIs.
- **`zip_extract.py`**: Handles extraction and processing of XML data from ZIP files.
- **`transform_load.py`**: Contains functions for data transformation and loading into the database.
- **`CSVview.py`**: Contains a script you can run on the DB to summarise the contents in CSV form.
- **`HTMLview.py`**: Contains a script you can run on the DB to summarise the contents in HTML form.
- **`measure_latency.py`**: A script to compare the response time to the recorded at time to find the record with the best latency.


## Configuration

- API endpoints and parameters can be configured in `main.py`.
- ZIP file URLs are specified in `main.py` for the ZIP processing mode.
- The SQLite database file is dynamically generated with a timestamped filename.
